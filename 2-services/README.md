## Specifications

1. convert the last project into a MCL note-taking service
  * This service allows users to take notes in a json file
  * Everything must be exported through index.js - for easy use
  * Users can ...

      * read a single not
      * read all notes
      * update a note
      * remove a note
      * view all possible commands & the arguments they take
      * get a meaningful message or error after each command executed
      * initialize a new notes file in a new directory
